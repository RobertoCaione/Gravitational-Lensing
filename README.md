# Gravitational-Lensing
Gravitational Lensing is an astrophysical phenomenon according to a  distribution of matter, such as a star, a galaxy 
or a cluster of galaxies, between a distant light source and an observer, that is capable of bending the light from the 
source as the light travels towards the observer.
